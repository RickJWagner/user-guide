= Using Cosign to verify Stonesoup build signatures & attestations

In this section we'll provide examples showing how to use cosign to verify
signatures and attestations for builds created by Stonesoup.

For detailed information on Cosign refer to the
link:https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/overview/[official documentation].

== Introduction

Stonesoup uses link:https://tekton.dev/docs/chains/[Tekton Chains] to sign the
images created by Stonesoup build pipelines, and to create signed attestations
that include details about the Tekton pipeline run that created the image.

It's possible to verify these signatures and view the attestation directly
using cosign. This does require that you know the image ref of the container
image that was created, (i.e. the container repository and a tag or digest), of
the image that was created, and that you have access to that repository.
