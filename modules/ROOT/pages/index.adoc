= The Enterprise Contract Cookbook

:numbered:

These docs are intendend to describe how to configure and use Enterprise
Contract with Stonesoup.

Rather than describe the low-level components of EC, this will focus on
high-level user interactions with Enterprise Contract via the Stonesoup UI.

These docs may be folded in to a Stonesoup User Guide in the future.

[IMPORTANT]
====
- The Enterprise Contract and the Stonesoup UI is evolving rapidly. We'll aim to
  keep this documentation current, but beware that parts of this documentation
  may become out of date quickly.
- This documentation includes notes and comments that are not suitable for
  inclusion in customer-facing documentation. This content could be adapted
  for use in customer-facing docs, but currently it's not suitable for that
  purpose.
