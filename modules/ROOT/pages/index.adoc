= The Enterprise Contract Cookbook

:numbered:

These docs are intendend to describe how to configure and use Enterprise
Contract with Stonesoup.

Rather than describe the low-level components of EC, this will focus on
high-level user interactions with Enterprise Contract via the Stonesoup UI.

These docs may be folded in to a Stonesoup User Guide in the future.
