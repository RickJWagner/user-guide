:numbered:

These docs are intended to describe how to configure and use Enterprise
Contract with Red Hat Trusted Application Pipeline (RHTAP).

Rather than describe the low-level components of EC, this will focus on
high-level user interactions with Enterprise Contract via RHTAP.

These docs may be folded in to an RHTAP User Guide in the future.

IMPORTANT: The Enterprise Contract and RHTAP are evolving rapidly.
We'll aim to keep this documentation current, but beware that parts of this
documentation may become out of date quickly.

IMPORTANT: This documentation includes notes and comments that are not suitable
for inclusion in customer-facing documentation. This content could be adapted
for use in customer-facing docs, but currently it's not suitable for that
purpose.
