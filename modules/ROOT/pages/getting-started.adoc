= Getting started with Enterprise Contract and Stonesoup

== Creating a new application

While preparing this documentation I'm working with a real example application
on the stage Stonesoup cluster so I'll share the details about it for reference.

If you have an application already you can skip this part.

The application was created Feb 20 using my personal fork of one the node-js
sample applications, specifically
link:https://github.com/simonbaird/devfile-sample[this one].

Creating the application:

I chose "Custom build", added the GitHub application permissions, and merged
the automated pull request.

A few minutes later:

== Adding an integration test

NOTE: In future this step might not be required since a
default `IntegrationTestScenario` will be automatically created and
presumably visible in the "Integration Tests" tab. See
link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/HACBS-1616[HACBS-1616] for details.

By default the "Integrations" tab is not visible. To make it appear, I visited
the applications url with `mvp=false` appended as a url param. In my case the url was
link:https://console.dev.redhat.com/hac/stonesoup/workspaces/sbaird/applications?mvp=false[this].

The "Integration Test" tab before there any integrations are created:

.Initially empty integration tests tab
image::f8f19cb5e499e40bcc3e549b93061095.png[]

Fill in the fields as follows:

Integration test name:: Use whatever you like for the name. I called mine `ec-policy-check`.

Image bundle:: `quay.io/redhat-appstudio-tekton-catalog/pipeline-enterprise-contract:devel`

Pipeline to run:: `enterprise-contract`

Optional for release:: It's up to you, but I left it unchecked to indicate that I don't want to
release anything that is failing the policy check.

[TIP]
====
- The source for the Tekton pipeline defined in that bundle is
  link:https://github.com/redhat-appstudio/build-definitions/blob/main/pipelines/enterprise-contract.yaml[here
  in the build-definitions repo].
- The source the the Tekton task used by that pipeline is in a different place. It is
  link:https://github.com/hacbs-contract/ec-cli/blob/main/tasks/verify-enterprise-contract/0.1/verify-enterprise-contract.yaml[here
  in the ec-cli repo].
- If you prefer to pin the pipeline bundle to a particular version, instead of using the `devel` tag, use one of the pinned tags
  link:https://quay.io/repository/redhat-appstudio-tekton-catalog/pipeline-enterprise-contract?tab=tags[visible here]. Note that the
  name of the tag matches a commit sha in the link:https://github.com/redhat-appstudio/build-definitions[build-definitions repo].

== Running the newly created Integration Test

NOTE: I don't believe there's any way to trigger the new integration test other
than by pushing a new commit to the application component's source repo, which
triggers a full rebuild of the component. It would be nice if it were possible
to manually trigger this pipeline, especially when experimenting with different
Enterprise Contract policies.

To trigger a rebuild, make a commit in the GitHub repo for the component.
link:https://github.com/simonbaird/devfile-sample/commit/992e3771152d2c7a312a6d71b285050f850c5f3c[Here
is mine].

This should trigger a new build-pipeline, and when that's done, the newly
created Integration Test pipeline should be triggered.

You can look for those pipeline runs in the "Activity" tab, or under the "Integration Tests" tab.

.The top pipeline run is the EC Integration Test

.Finding the same pipeline run in via the Integration Tests tab

Looking at the logs for the that pipeline run we should see that the bottom line is `success: true`
which indicates the EC policy check passed.

NOTE: The name of the pipeline run here, `my-node-app-x62j4-jqs4j` is not very
user-friendly. Calling it `my-node-app-ec-policy-check-jqs4j` might be nicer,
but perhaps there's a problem with the name length constraints.

== Inspecting the default EC configuration

So the EC policy checked passed, but so far it's not very clear yet what
exactly passed and what policies were applied. Let's take a closer look.
