= Getting started with Enterprise Contract and Stonesoup

== Creating a new application

While preparing this documentation I'm working with a real example application
on the stage Stonesoup cluster so I'll share the details about it for reference.

If you have an application already you can skip this part.

The application was created Feb 20 using my personal fork of one the node-js
sample applications, specifically
link:https://github.com/simonbaird/devfile-sample[this one].

Creating the application:

.Application creation screen

I chose "Custom build", added the GitHub application permissions, and merged
the automated pull request.

A few minutes later:

== Adding an integration test

NOTE: In future this step might not be required since a
default `IntegrationTestScenario` will be automatically created and
presumably visible in the "Integration Tests" tab. See
link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/HACBS-1616[HACBS-1616] for details.

By default the "Integrations" tab is not visible. To make it appear, I visited
the applications url with `mvp=false` appended as a url param. In my case the url was
link:https://console.dev.redhat.com/hac/stonesoup/workspaces/sbaird/applications?mvp=false[this].

The "Integration Test" tab before there any integrations are created:

.Initially empty integration tests tab
image::f8f19cb5e499e40bcc3e549b93061095.png[]

Fill in the fields as follows:

Integration test name:: Use whatever you like for the name. I called mine `ec-policy-check`.

Image bundle:: `quay.io/redhat-appstudio-tekton-catalog/pipeline-enterprise-contract:devel`

Pipeline to run:: `enterprise-contract`

Optional for release:: It's up to you, but I left it unchecked to indicate that I don't want to
release anything that is failing the policy check.

[TIP]
====
- The source for the Tekton pipeline defined in that bundle is
  link:https://github.com/redhat-appstudio/build-definitions/blob/main/pipelines/enterprise-contract.yaml[here
  in the build-definitions repo].
- The source the the Tekton task used by that pipeline is in a different place. It is
  link:https://github.com/enterprise-contract/ec-cli/blob/main/tasks/verify-enterprise-contract/0.1/verify-enterprise-contract.yaml[here
  in the ec-cli repo].
- If you prefer to pin the pipeline bundle to a particular version, instead of using the `devel` tag, use one of the pinned tags
  link:https://quay.io/repository/redhat-appstudio-tekton-catalog/pipeline-enterprise-contract?tab=tags[visible here]. Note that the
  name of the tag matches a commit sha in the link:https://github.com/redhat-appstudio/build-definitions[build-definitions repo].

== Running the newly created Integration Test

NOTE: I don't believe there's any way to trigger the new integration test other
than by pushing a new commit to the application component's source repo, which
triggers a full rebuild of the component. It would be nice if it were possible
to manually trigger this pipeline, especially when experimenting with different
Enterprise Contract policies.

To trigger a rebuild, make a commit in the GitHub repo for the component.
link:https://github.com/simonbaird/devfile-sample/commit/992e3771152d2c7a312a6d71b285050f850c5f3c[Here
is mine].

This should trigger a new build-pipeline, and when that's done, the newly
created Integration Test pipeline should be triggered.

You can look for those pipeline runs in the "Activity" tab, or under the "Integration Tests" tab.

.The top pipeline run is the EC Integration Test

.Finding the same pipeline run in via the Integration Tests tab
image::20c3acf266e41615df71f54c11b38c1f.png[]

Looking at the logs for the that pipeline run we should see that the bottom line is `success: true`
which indicates the EC policy check passed.

.View the task run log for the EC task

NOTE: The name of the pipeline run here, `my-node-app-x62j4-jqs4j` is not very
user-friendly. Calling it `my-node-app-ec-policy-check-jqs4j` might be nicer,
but perhaps there's a problem with the name length constraints.

== Inspecting the default EC configuration

So the EC policy checked passed, but so far it's not very clear yet what
exactly passed and what policies were applied. Let's take a closer look.

=== Command line credentials

We want to access the cluster using kubectl and oc, so let's get the credentials for that.

The link to get a token is link:https://registration-service-toolchain-host-operator.apps.stone-stg-host1.hjvn.p1.openshiftapps.com/[this one].
Authenticate, then click the "Proxy login command" link in the top right.

.Copying the 'oc login --token...' command
image::c90a10af101399fadaa3ab5bc81597ef.png[]

Paste the login command in your terminal and you should logged in to the cluster.

[,bash]
----
$ oc login --token=<very-long-token> --server=<server-url>
Logged into "https://api-toolchain-host-operator.apps.stone-stg-host1.hjvn.p1.openshiftapps.com:443" as "sbaird" using the token provided.

You have one project on this server: "sbaird-tenant"

Using project "sbaird-tenant".
----

=== The IntegrationTestScenario record

Before we look at the Enterprise Contract Configuration, let's look at the
Integration Test Scenario. This is the record that corresponds to the
integration test visible under the "Integration Tests". In my case it's called
`ec-policy-check`.

Listing all the IntegrationTestScenario records:

[,bash]
----
$ oc get integrationtestscenario
NAME              APPLICATION
ec-policy-check   my-node-app
----

Inspecting the ec-policy-check IntegrationTestScenario record.

NOTE: In this example I'm filtering out the majority of the metadata since it's
not particularly interesting for the purposes of these docs.

[,bash]
----
$ oc get integrationtestscenario ec-policy-check -o yaml | yq '.metadata |= {"name":.name,"namespace":.namespace}'
----

[,yaml]
----
apiVersion: appstudio.redhat.com/v1alpha1
kind: IntegrationTestScenario
metadata:
  name: ec-policy-check
  namespace: sbaird-tenant
spec:
  application: my-node-app
  bundle: quay.io/redhat-appstudio-tekton-catalog/pipeline-enterprise-contract:devel
  contexts:
    - description: Application testing
      name: application
  pipeline: enterprise-contract
status:
  conditions:
    - lastTransitionTime: "2023-02-20T22:40:03Z"
      message: Integration test scenario is Valid.
      reason: Valid
      status: "True"
      type: IntegrationTestScenarioValid
----

Actually there's not a lot to pay attention to here. Notice the bundle and the
pipeline which were entered via the UI. Later we'll we'll be modifying this
record to add some params that will be passed to the integration test pipeline.

=== The EnterpriseContractPolicy record

It's not trivial to find which configuration is being used for the Enterprise
Contract. The answer is in the value of the pipeline param called
`POLICY_CONFIGURATION`,
link:https://github.com/redhat-appstudio/build-definitions/blob/main/pipelines/enterprise-contract.yaml#L30[see here].

The value of that default is `enterprise-contract-service/default`.

We can use that to find the relevant EnterpriseContractPolicy record:

[,bash]
----
$ oc get -n enterprise-contract-service enterprisecontractpolicy default -o yaml | yq .spec
----

[,yaml]
----
configuration:
  collections:
    - minimal
description: |
  Default EnterpriseContractPolicy. If a different policy is desired, this resource can serve as a starting point.
